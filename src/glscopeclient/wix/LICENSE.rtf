Additional Definitions.\line\line   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU\line General Public License.\line\line   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\line other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\line\line   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\line by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\line Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\line of using an interface provided by the Library.\line\line   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an\line Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\line with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked\line Version".\line\line   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the\line Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\line for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\line based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\line\line   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the\line object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\line and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\line Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\line\line   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line\line   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\line without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line\line   2. Conveying Modified Versions.\line\line   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\line facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\line that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\line facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\line version:\line\line    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\line    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\line    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\line    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\line\line    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\line    this License applicable to that copy.\line\line   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\line\line   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\line a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\line code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\line material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\line layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\line (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\line\line    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\line    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line    covered by this License.\line\line    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line    document.\line\line   4. Combined Works.\line\line   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\line taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\line portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\line the following:\line\line    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\line    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line    covered by this License.\line\line    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line    document.\line\line    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\line    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\line    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\line    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line\line    d) Do one of the following:\line\line        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\line        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\line        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\line        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\line        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\line        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\line        Corresponding Source.\line\line        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\line        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\line        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\line        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\line        Version.\line\line    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\line    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\line    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\line    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\line    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\line    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\line    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\line    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\line    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\line    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\line    for conveying Corresponding Source.)\line\line   5. Combined Libraries.\line\line   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side by side in a single library together with other library\line facilities that\f1\par
\f0  are not Applications and are not covered by this\line License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\line choice, if you do both of the following:\line\line    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\line    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\line    conveyed under the terms of this License.\line\line    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\line    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\line    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\line\line   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\line versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\line differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\line Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\line of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\line applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that published version or of any later version\line published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\line received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\line\line   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\line whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\line apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\line permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\line Library.\line\tab\tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line\tab\tab        Version 2, June 1991\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line     \tab\tab     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\line  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\line\line\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\line other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\line your libraries, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\line you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\line with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\line the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\line version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\line the original authors' reputations.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line\line   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line\line   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line\line   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line\line   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line\f1\par
\f0\line\tab\tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Library General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the \line     Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, \line     Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line\line   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line\line   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\line   Ty Coon, President of Vice\line\line That's all there is to it!\line\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                        Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line\tab 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\line be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\line     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\line     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\line     performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.

\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is\line  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\line\line\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\line other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\line your libraries, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\line you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\line with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\line the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\line version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\line the original authors' reputations.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line\line   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line\line   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line\line   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line\line   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line\f1\par
\f0\line\tab\tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par

You may convey such object\line code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\line material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\line layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\line (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\line\line    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\line    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line    covered by this License.\line\line    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line    document.\line\line   4. Combined Works.\line\line   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\line taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\line portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\line the following:\line\line    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\line    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line    covered by this License.\line\line    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line    document.\line\line    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\line    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\line    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\line    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line\line    d) Do one of the following:\line\line        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\line        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\line        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\line        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\line        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\line        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\line        Corresponding Source.\line\line        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\line        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\line        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\line        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\line        Version. \line\line    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\line    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\line    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\line    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\line    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\line    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\line    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\line    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\line    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\line    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\line    for conveying Corresponding Source.)\line\line   5. Combined Libraries.\line\line   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side by side in a single library together with other library\line facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\line License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\line choice, if you do both of the following:\line\line    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\line    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\line    conveyed under the terms of this License.\line\line    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\line    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\line    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\line\line   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\line versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\line differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\line Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\line of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\line applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that published version or of any later version\line published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\line received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\line\line   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\line whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\line apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\line permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\line Library.\line Copyright (c) 2009, 2010, 2013-2016 by the Brotli Authors.\line\line Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\line of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\line in\f1\par

It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\line be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\line     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\line     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\line     performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Application of License.\line      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\line      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\line      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\line      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\line      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\line      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\line      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\line      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\line      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\line      an additional document offering the additional\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  rights described in\line      Section 3.5.\line\line      3.2. Availability of Source Code.\line      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\line      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\line      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\line      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\line      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\line      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\line      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\line      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\line      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\line      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\line      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\line\line      3.3. Description of Modifications.\line      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\line      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\line      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\line      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\line      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\line      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\line      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\line      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\line\line      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\line           (a) Third Party Claims.\line           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\line           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\line           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\line           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\line           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the\line           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\line           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\line           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\line           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\line           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\line           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\line           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\line           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\line\line           (b) Contributor APIs.\line           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\line           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\line           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\line           also include this information in the LEGAL file.\line\line                (c)    Representations.\line           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\line           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\line           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\line           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\line           this License.\line\line      3.5. Required Notices.\line      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\line      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\line      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\line      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\line      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\line      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\line      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\line      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\line      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\line      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\line      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\line      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\line      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\line      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\line      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\line      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\line      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\line      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\line\line      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\line      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\line      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\line      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\line      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\line      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\line      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\line      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\line      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\line      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\line      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\line      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\line      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\line      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\line      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\line      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\line      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\line      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\line      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\line      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\line      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\line      terms You offer.\line\line      3.7. Larger Works.\line      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\line      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\line      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\line      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\line\line 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\line\line      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\line      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\line      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\line      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\line      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\line      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\line      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\line      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\line      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\line      understand it.\line\line 5. Application of this License.\line\line      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\line      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\line\line 6. Versions of the License.\line\line      6.1. New Versions.\line      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised\line      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\line      will be given a distinguishing version number.\line\line      6.2. Effect of New Versions.\line      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\line      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\line      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\line      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\line      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\line      Covered Code created under this License.\line\line      6.3. Derivative Works.\line      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\line      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\line      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\line      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",\line      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\line      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\line      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\line      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\line      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\line      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\line      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\line      this License.)\line\line 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\line\line      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,\line      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\line      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\line      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\line      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\line      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\line      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\line      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\line      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\line      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\line\line 8. TERMINATION.\line\line      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\line      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\line      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\line      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\line      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\line      nature,\f1\par
\f0  must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\line      shall survive.\line\line      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\line      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\line      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\line      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:\line\line      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\line      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\line      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\line      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\line      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\line      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\line      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\line      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\line      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\line      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\line      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\line      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\line      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\line      the 60 day notice period specified above.\line\line      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\line      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\line      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\line      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\line      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\line      Participant.\line\line      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\line      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\line      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\line      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\line      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\line      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\line      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\line      license.\line\line      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\line      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\line      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\line      prior to termination shall survive termination.\line\line 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\line\line      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\line      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\line      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\line      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\line      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\line      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\line      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\line      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\line      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\line      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\line      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\line      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\line      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\line      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\line\line 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\line\line      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in\line      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer\line      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such\line      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\line      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\line      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\line      rights set forth herein.\line\line 11. MISCELLANEOUS.\line\line      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\line      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\line      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\line      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\line      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\line      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\line      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\line      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\line      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\line      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\line      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\line      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\line      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\line      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\line      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\line      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\line      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\line      License.\line\line 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\line\line      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\line      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\line      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\line      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\line      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\line      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\line\line 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\line\line      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\line      "Multiple-Licensed".

It is\line  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\line\line\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\line other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\line your libraries, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\line you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\line complete\f1\par
\f0  object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\line with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\line the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\line version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\line the original authors' reputations.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line\line   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line\line   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line\line   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line\line   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line\f1\par
\f0\line\tab\tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16.

\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

So\line probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a\line permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files\line in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the\line version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming\line from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.\line\line ===================================\line Headers and IDLs imported from Wine\line ===================================\line\line Some header and IDL files were imported from the Wine project.

See the GNU\line Lesser General Public License for more details.\line MinGW-w64 licensing\line *******************\line\line The copyright and license notices have been divided in two files:\line The notices in COPYING.MinGW-w64.txt (this file) apply only to\line MinGW-w64 itself. These don't apply to the binaries built with\line MinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against\line these parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.\line\line In addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in\line COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly\line all) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with\line this version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary\line packages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy\line COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the\line license requirements of the MinGW runtime.\line\line If you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to\line remove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always\line get linked in if you use any printf-like function. So usually it is\line easiest and safest to just keep all the notices.\line\line\line ====================\line GCC and GNU binutils\line ====================\line\line Copyright (C) Free Software Foundation\line License: GNU GPLv3+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv3)\line\line\line ==============\line Profiling code\line ==============\line\line Copyright 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Red Hat, Inc.\line License: GNU GPLv2+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv2)\line\line         *       *       *       *       *       *       *\line\line Copyright (c) 1982, 1983, 1986, 1992, 1993\line      The Regents of the University of California.

It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your\f1\par
\f0  rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line\tab\tab   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Lesser General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line\line   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line\line   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\line   Ty Coon, President of Vice\line\line That's all there is to it!\line\line\line\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                        Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line\tab 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\line be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\line     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\line     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\line     performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Lesser General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\line your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,\line if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line\line   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James\line   Random Hacker.\line\line   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\line   Ty Coon, President of Vice\line\line That's all there is to it!\line\line\line GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\line\line Version 3.1, 31 March 2009\line\line Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://fsf.org/"}}{\fldrslt{http://fsf.org/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >\line\line Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\line license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional\line permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version\line 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that\line bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\line the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\line\line When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\line certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\line program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\line non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\line header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\line\line 0. Definitions.\line\line A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime\line Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\line interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\line on the Runtime Library.\line\line "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\line modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\line the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\line subsequent versions published by the FSF.\line\line "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,\line modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\line the license of GCC.\line\line "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\line target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\line input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\line phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\line format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\line for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\line\line The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in\line non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\line Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\line use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\line part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\line understood as starting with the output of the generators or\line preprocessors.\line\line A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or\line with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\line work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\line optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\line Eligible Compilation Process.\line\line 1. Grant of Additional Permission.\line\line You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\line combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\line propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\line all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\line may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\line consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\line\line 2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\line\line The availability of this Exception does not imply any general\line presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\line requirements of the license of GCC.\line\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                        Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Lesser General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line\line   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line\line   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\line   Ty Coon, President of Vice\line\line That's all there is to it!\line                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                        Version 3, 29 June 2007\line\line  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://fsf.org/"}}{\fldrslt{http://fsf.org/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\line software and other kinds of works.\line\line   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\line to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\line the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\line share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\line software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\line GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\line any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\line your programs, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\line want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\line free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\line these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\line certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\line you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\line freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\line or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\line know their rights.\line\line   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\line (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\line giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\line\line   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\line that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\line authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\line changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\line authors of previous versions.\line\line   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\line modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\line can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\line protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\line pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\line use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\line have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\line products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\line stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\line of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\line\line   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\line States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\line software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\line avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\line make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\line patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\line\line                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\line   0. Definitions.\line\line   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\line\line   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\line works, such as semiconductor masks.\line\line   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\line License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and\line "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.\line\line   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\line in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\line exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the\line earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.\line\line   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\line on the Program.\line\line   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without\line permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\line infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\line computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\line distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\line public, and in some countries other activities as well.\line\line   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\line parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\line a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\line\line   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"\line to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\line feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\line tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\line extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\line work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\line the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\line menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\line\line   1. Source Code.\line\line   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work\line for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source\line form of a work.\line\line   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official\line standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\line interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\line is widely used among developers working in that language.\line\line   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other\line than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\line packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\line Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\line Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\line implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\line "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component\line (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\line (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\line produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\line\line   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all\line the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\line work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\line control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\line System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\line programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\line which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\line includes interface definition files associated with source files for\line the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\line linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\line such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\line subprograms and other parts of the work.\line\line   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\line can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\line Source.\line\line   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\line same work.\line\line   2. Basic Permissions.\line\line   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\line copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\line conditions\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\line permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\line covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\line content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\line rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\line\line   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\line convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\line in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\line of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\line with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\line the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\line not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\line for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\line and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\line your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\line\line   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\line the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\line makes it unnecessary.\line\line   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\line\line   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\line measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\line 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\line similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\line measures.\line\line   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\line circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\line is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\line the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\line modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\line users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\line technological measures.\line\line   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\line\line   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\line receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\line appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\line keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\line non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\line keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\line recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\line\line   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\line and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\line\line   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\line\line   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\line produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\line terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\line     it, and giving a relevant date.\line\line     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\line     released under this License and any conditions added under section\line     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\line     "keep intact all notices".\line\line     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\line     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\line     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\line     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\line     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\line     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\line     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\line\line     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\line     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\line     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\line     work need not make them do so.\line\line   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\line works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\line and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\line in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\line "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\line used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\line beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\line in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\line parts of the aggregate.\line\line   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\line\line   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\line of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\line machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\line in one of these ways:\line\line     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\line     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\line     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\line     customarily used for software interchange.\line\line     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\line     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\line     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\line     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\line     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\line     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\line     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\line     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\line     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\line     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\line     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\line\line     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\line     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\line     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\line     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\line     with subsection 6b.\line\line     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\line     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\line     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\line     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\line     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\line     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\line     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\line     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\line     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\line     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\line     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\line     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\line\line     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\line     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\line     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\line     charge under subsection 6d.\line\line   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\line from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\line included in conveying the object code work.\line\line   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any\line tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\line or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\line into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\line doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\line product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a\line typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\line of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\line actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\line is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\line commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\line the only significant mode of use of the product.\line\line   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,\line procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\line and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\line a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\line suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\line code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\line modification has been made.\line\line   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\line specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\line part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\line User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\line fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\line Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\line by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\line if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\line modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\line been installed in ROM).\line\line   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\line requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\line for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\line the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\line network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\line adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\line protocols for communication across the network.\line\line   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\line in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\line documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\line source code form), and must require no special password or key for\line unpacking,\f1\par
\f0  reading or copying.\line\line   7. Additional Terms.\line\line   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this\line License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\line Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\line be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\line that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\line apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\line under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\line this License without regard to the additional permissions.\line\line   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\line remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\line it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\line removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\line additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\line for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\line\line   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\line add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\line that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\line\line     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\line     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\line\line     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\line     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\line     Notices displayed by works containing it; or\line\line     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\line     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\line     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\line\line     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\line     authors of the material; or\line\line     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\line     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\line\line     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\line     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\line     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\line     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\line     those licensors and authors.\line\line   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further\line restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\line received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\line governed by this License along with a term that is a further\line restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\line a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\line License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\line of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\line not survive such relicensing or conveying.\line\line   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\line must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\line additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\line where to find the applicable terms.\line\line   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\line form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\line the above requirements apply either way.\line\line   8. Termination.\line\line   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\line provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\line modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\line this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\line paragraph of section 11).\line\line   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\line license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\line provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\line finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\line holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\line prior to 60 days after the cessation.\line\line   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\line reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\line violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\line received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\line copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\line your receipt of the notice.\line\line   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\line licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\line this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\line reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\line material under section 10.\line\line   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\line\line   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\line run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\line occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\line to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\line nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\line modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\line not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\line covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\line\line   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\line\line   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\line receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\line propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\line for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\line\line   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an\line organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\line organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\line work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\line transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\line licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\line give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\line Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\line the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\line\line   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\line rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\line not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\line rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\line (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\line any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\line sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\line\line   11. Patents.\line\line   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\line License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\line work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".\line\line   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims\line owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\line hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\line by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\line but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\line consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\line purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant\line patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\line this License.\line\line   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\line patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\line make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\line propagate the contents of its contributor version.\line\line   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express\line agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\line (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\line sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a\line party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\line patent against the party.\line\line   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\line and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\line to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\line publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\line then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\line available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\line patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\line consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\line license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have\line actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\line covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\line in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\line country that you have reason to believe are valid.\line\line   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\line arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\line covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\line receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\line or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\line you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\line work and works based on it.\line\line   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within\line the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\line conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\line specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\line work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\line in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\line to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\line the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of\f1\par
\f0  the\line parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\line patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\line conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\line for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\line contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\line or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\line\line   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\line any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\line otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\line\line   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\line\line   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\line covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\line not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\line to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\line the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\line License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\line\line   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\line\line   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\line permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\line under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\line combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\line License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\line but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\line section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\line combination as such.\line\line   14. Revised Versions of this License.\line\line   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\line the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line address new problems or concerns.\line\line   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\line Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\line Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the\line option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\line version or of any later version published by the Free Software\line Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\line GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\line by the Free Software Foundation.\line\line   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\line versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\line public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\line to choose that version for the Program.\line\line   Later license versions may give you additional or different\line permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\line author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\line later version.\line\line   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\line\line   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\line APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\line HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY\line OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\line THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\line IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\line ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. Limitation of Liability.\line\line   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\line THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\line GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\line USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\line DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\line PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\line EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\line SUCH DAMAGES.\line\line   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\line\line   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\line above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\line reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\line an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\line Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\line copy of the Program in return for a fee.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\line             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\line\line   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\line free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\line\line   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\line to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\line the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\line     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\line     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\line     (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\line     GNU General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\line     along with this program.  If not, see <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/"}}{\fldrslt{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >.\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\line notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\line\line     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\line     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\line     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\line\line The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\line parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\line might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".\line\line   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\line if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.\line For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\line <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/"}}{\fldrslt{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >.\line\line   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\line into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\line may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\line the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\line Public License instead of this License.

It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or\f1\par
\f0  if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy,\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line ^L\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line ^L\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line ^L\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it\line does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Lesser General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,\line     MA 02110-1301, USA\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\line mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\line your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.

It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed\f1\par
\f0  that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy,\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line ^L\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line ^L\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line ^L\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it\line does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.

\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Lesser General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line\line   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line\line   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\line   Ty Coon, President of Vice\line\line That's all there is to it!\line\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                        Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy,\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line ^L\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line ^L\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line ^L\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

\f0  2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\line be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\line     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\line     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\line     performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\line other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\line your libraries, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\line you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\line with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\line the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\line version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\line the original authors' reputations.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line\line   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line\line   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line\line   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line\line   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Library General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line\line   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line\line   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\line   Ty Coon, President of Vice\line\line That's all there is to it!\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                        Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

So\line probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a\line permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files\line in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the\line version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming\line from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.\line\line ===================================\line Headers and IDLs imported from Wine\line ===================================\line\line Some header and IDL files were imported from the Wine project.

These don't apply to the binaries built with\line MinGW-w64 unless you specifically tell MinGW-w64 to link against\line these parts, for example, by enabling profiling code.\line\line In addition to the notices in this file, also the notices in\line COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt apply to MinGW-w64. Some (possibly\line all) notices in that file may apply also to the binaries built with\line this version of MinGW-w64. The idea is that if you create binary\line packages of your software with MinGW-w64, you can simply copy\line COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt into your package to fulfill the\line license requirements of the MinGW runtime.\line\line If you think that not all notices apply to your package and want to\line remove some of them, note that, for example, the gdtoa files always\line get linked in if you use any printf-like function. So usually it is\line easiest and safest to just keep all the notices.\line\line\line ====================\line GCC and GNU binutils\line ====================\line\line Copyright (C) Free Software Foundation\line License: GNU GPLv3+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv3)\line\line\line ==============\line Profiling code\line ==============\line\line Copyright 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 Red Hat, Inc.\line License: GNU GPLv2+ (see the file COPYING.GPLv2)\line\line         *       *       *       *       *       *       *\line\line Copyright (c) 1982, 1983, 1986, 1992, 1993\line      The Regents of the University of California.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\line License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\line software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\line General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\line Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\line using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\line the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\line your programs, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\line distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\line you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\line source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\line rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\line (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\line distribute and/or modify the software.\line\line   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\line that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\line authors' reputations.\line\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\line program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\line program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\line patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\line\line\line\tab\tab     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\line a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\line under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\line refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\line means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\line that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\line either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\line language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\line the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\line is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\line Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\line Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\line source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\line conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\line copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\line notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\line and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\line along with the Program.\line\line You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\line you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\line     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\line     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\line     parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\line     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\line     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\line     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\line     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\line     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\line     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\line     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\line     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\line     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\line\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work\f1\par
\f0  are not derived from the Program,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Program.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\line with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\line under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\line Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\line\line     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\line     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\line     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line\line     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\line     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\line     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\line     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\line     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\line     customarily used for software interchange; or,\line\line     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\line     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\line     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\line     received the program in object code or executable form with such\line     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\line\line The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\line code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\line associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\line control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\line special exception, the source code distributed need not include\line anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\line form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\line operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\line itself accompanies the executable.\line\line If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\line access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\line access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\line distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line\line   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\line otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Program or works based on it.\line\line   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\line   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line\line   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\line those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\line later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\line either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\line Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\line this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\line Foundation.\line\line   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\line to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\line Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\line make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\line of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\line of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\line FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\line OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\line PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\line OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\line MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\line TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\line PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\line REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\line REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\line INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\line OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\line TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\line YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\line PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\line POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line\line\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\line\line\tab     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\line\line   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\line free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\line\line   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line\tab\tab   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\line be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\line     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\line     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\line     performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is\line  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\line\line\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\line other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\line your libraries, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\line you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\line with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\line the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\line version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\line the original authors' reputations.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line\line   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line\line   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line\line   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line\line   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line\f1\par
\f0\line\tab\tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Library General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free\line     Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,\line     MA 02110-1301, USA\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\line you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\line with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\line the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\line version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\line the original authors' reputations.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line\line   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line\line   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line\line   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line\line   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line\f1\par
\f0\line\tab\tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some information can also be found in the JPEG\line FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article.  See ARCHIVE LOCATIONS below to find\line out where to obtain the FAQ article.\line\line If you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or\line more of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly\line the order listed) before diving into the code.\line\line\line OVERVIEW\line ========\line\line This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,\line and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression\line method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing\line photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and\line brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or\line other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG\line quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such\line images.\line\line JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to\line the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other "smooth" images,\line very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression\line artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are\line willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the "quality" setting in the\line compressor.)\line\line This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive\line compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these\line processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.\line We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless\line processes defined in the standard.\line\line We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,\line plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to\line perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.\line The library is intended to be reused in other applications.\line\line In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included\line considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;\line for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG\line decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or\line colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the\line library if not required for a particular application.\line\line We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between\line different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple\line applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.\line\line The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and\line flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,\line the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the\line REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to\line be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have\line achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.\line\line We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.\line No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product\line documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.\line\line\line LEGAL ISSUES\line ============\line\line In plain English:\line\line 1.

The book's JPEG\line sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look\line at a full implementation, you've got one here...\line\line The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still\line Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.\line Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.\line Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG\line standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).\line\line The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual\line specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.

On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg,\line all else being equal.  On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still\line outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized\line Huffman coding routines.  In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo\line rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.\line\line libjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less\line powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API.  libjpeg-turbo also features\line colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and\line big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java\line interface.\line\line libjpeg-turbo was originally based on libjpeg/SIMD, an MMX-accelerated\line derivative of libjpeg v6b developed by Miyasaka Masaru.  The TigerVNC and\line VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to the codec in 2009, and in\line early 2010, libjpeg-turbo spun off into an independent project, with the goal\line of making high-speed JPEG compression/decompression technology available to a\line broader range of users and developers.\line\line\line License\line =======\line\line libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses.\line Refer to [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for a roll-up of license terms.\line\line\line Building libjpeg-turbo\line ======================\line\line Refer to [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for complete instructions.\line\line\line Using libjpeg-turbo\line ===================\line\line libjpeg-turbo includes two APIs that can be used to compress and decompress\line JPEG images:\line\line - **TurboJPEG API**<br>\line   This API provides an easy-to-use interface for compressing and decompressing\line   JPEG images in memory.  It also provides some functionality that would not be\line   straightforward to achieve using the underlying libjpeg API, such as\line   generating planar YUV images and performing multiple simultaneous lossless\line   transforms on an image.  The Java interface for libjpeg-turbo is written on\line   top of the TurboJPEG API.  The TurboJPEG API is recommended for first-time\line   users of libjpeg-turbo.  Refer to [tjexample.c](tjexample.c) and\line   [TJExample.java](java/TJExample.java) for examples of its usage and to\line   <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://libjpeg-turbo.org/Documentation/Documentation"}}{\fldrslt{http://libjpeg-turbo.org/Documentation/Documentation\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 > for API documentation.\line\line - **libjpeg API**<br>\line   This is the de facto industry-standard API for compressing and decompressing\line   JPEG images.  It is more difficult to use than the TurboJPEG API but also\line   more powerful.  The libjpeg API implementation in libjpeg-turbo is both\line   API/ABI-compatible and mathematically compatible with libjpeg v6b.  It can\line   also optionally be configured to be API/ABI-compatible with libjpeg v7 and v8\line   (see below.)  Refer to [cjpeg.c](cjpeg.c) and [djpeg.c](djpeg.c) for examples\line   of its usage and to [libjpeg.txt](libjpeg.txt) for API documentation.\line\line There is no significant performance advantage to either API when both are used\line to perform similar operations.\line\line Colorspace Extensions\line ---------------------\line\line libjpeg-turbo includes extensions that allow JPEG images to be compressed\line directly from (and decompressed directly to) buffers that use BGR, BGRX,\line RGBX, XBGR, and XRGB pixel ordering.  This is implemented with ten new\line colorspace constants:\line\line     JCS_EXT_RGB   /* red/green/blue */\line     JCS_EXT_RGBX  /* red/green/blue/x */\line     JCS_EXT_BGR   /* blue/green/red */\line     JCS_EXT_BGRX  /* blue/green/red/x */\line     JCS_EXT_XBGR  /* x/blue/green/red */\line     JCS_EXT_XRGB  /* x/red/green/blue */\line     JCS_EXT_RGBA  /* red/green/blue/alpha */\line     JCS_EXT_BGRA  /* blue/green/red/alpha */\line     JCS_EXT_ABGR  /* alpha/blue/green/red */\line     JCS_EXT_ARGB  /* alpha/red/green/blue */\line\line Setting `cinfo.in_color_space` (compression) or `cinfo.out_color_space`\line (decompression) to one of these values will cause libjpeg-turbo to read the\line red, green, and blue values from (or write them to) the appropriate position in\line the pixel when compressing from/decompressing to an RGB buffer.\line\line Your application can check for the existence of these extensions at compile\line time with:\line\line     #ifdef JCS_EXTENSIONS\line\line At run time, attempting to use these extensions with a libjpeg implementation\line that does not support them will result in a "Bogus input colorspace" error.\line Applications can trap this error\f1\par
\f0  in order to test whether run-time support is\line available for the colorspace extensions.\line\line When using the RGBX, BGRX, XBGR, and XRGB colorspaces during decompression, the\line X byte is undefined, and in order to ensure the best performance, libjpeg-turbo\line can set that byte to whatever value it wishes.  If an application expects the X\line byte to be used as an alpha channel, then it should specify `JCS_EXT_RGBA`,\line `JCS_EXT_BGRA`, `JCS_EXT_ABGR`, or `JCS_EXT_ARGB`.  When these colorspace\line constants are used, the X byte is guaranteed to be 0xFF, which is interpreted\line as opaque.\line\line Your application can check for the existence of the alpha channel colorspace\line extensions at compile time with:\line\line     #ifdef JCS_ALPHA_EXTENSIONS\line\line [jcstest.c](jcstest.c), located in the libjpeg-turbo source tree, demonstrates\line how to check for the existence of the colorspace extensions at compile time and\line run time.\line\line libjpeg v7 and v8 API/ABI Emulation\line -----------------------------------\line\line With libjpeg v7 and v8, new features were added that necessitated extending the\line compression and decompression structures.  Unfortunately, due to the exposed\line nature of those structures, extending them also necessitated breaking backward\line ABI compatibility with previous libjpeg releases.  Thus, programs that were\line built to use libjpeg v7 or v8 did not work with libjpeg-turbo, since it is\line based on the libjpeg v6b code base.  Although libjpeg v7 and v8 are not\line as widely used as v6b, enough programs (including a few Linux distros) made\line the switch that there was a demand to emulate the libjpeg v7 and v8 ABIs\line in libjpeg-turbo.  It should be noted, however, that this feature was added\line primarily so that applications that had already been compiled to use libjpeg\line v7+ could take advantage of accelerated baseline JPEG encoding/decoding\line without recompiling.  libjpeg-turbo does not claim to support all of the\line libjpeg v7+ features, nor to produce identical output to libjpeg v7+ in all\line cases (see below.)\line\line By passing an argument of `-DWITH_JPEG7=1` or `-DWITH_JPEG8=1` to `cmake`, you\line can build a version of libjpeg-turbo that emulates the libjpeg v7 or v8 ABI, so\line that programs that are built against libjpeg v7 or v8 can be run with\line libjpeg-turbo.  The following section describes which libjpeg v7+ features are\line supported and which aren't.\line\line ### Support for libjpeg v7 and v8 Features\line\line #### Fully supported\line\line - **libjpeg API: IDCT scaling extensions in decompressor**<br>\line   libjpeg-turbo supports IDCT scaling with scaling factors of 1/8, 1/4, 3/8,\line   1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 7/8, 9/8, 5/4, 11/8, 3/2, 13/8, 7/4, 15/8, and 2/1 (only 1/4\line   and 1/2 are SIMD-accelerated.)\line\line - **libjpeg API: Arithmetic coding**\line\line - **libjpeg API: In-memory source and destination managers**<br>\line   See notes below.\line\line - **cjpeg: Separate quality settings for luminance and chrominance**<br>\line   Note that the libpjeg v7+ API was extended to accommodate this feature only\line   for convenience purposes.  It has always been possible to implement this\line   feature with libjpeg v6b (see rdswitch.c for an example.)\line\line - **cjpeg: 32-bit BMP support**\line\line - **cjpeg: `-rgb` option**\line\line - **jpegtran: Lossless cropping**\line\line - **jpegtran: `-perfect` option**\line\line - **jpegtran: Forcing width/height when performing lossless crop**\line\line - **rdjpgcom: `-raw` option**\line\line - **rdjpgcom: Locale awareness**\line\line\line #### Not supported\line\line NOTE:  As of this writing, extensive research has been conducted into the\line usefulness of DCT scaling as a means of data reduction and SmartScale as a\line means of quality improvement.  Readers are invited to peruse the research at\line <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.libjpeg-turbo.org/About/SmartScale"}}{\fldrslt{http://www.libjpeg-turbo.org/About/SmartScale\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 > and draw their own conclusions,\line but it is the general belief of our project that these features have not\line demonstrated sufficient usefulness to justify inclusion in libjpeg-turbo.\line\line - **libjpeg API: DCT scaling in compressor**<br>\line   `cinfo.scale_num` and `cinfo.scale_denom` are silently ignored.\line   There is no technical reason why DCT scaling could not be supported when\line   emulating the libjpeg v7+ API/ABI, but without the SmartScale extension (see\line   below), only scaling factors of 1/2, 8/15, 4/7, 8/13, 2/3, 8/11, 4/5, and\line   8/9 would be available, which is of limited usefulness.\line\line - **libjpeg API: SmartScale**<br>\line   `cinfo.block_size` is silently ignored.\line   SmartScale is an extension to the JPEG format that allows for DCT block\line   sizes other than 8x8.  Providing support for this new format would be\line   feasible (particularly without full acceleration.)  However, until/unless\line   the format becomes either an official industry standard or, at minimum, an\line   accepted solution in the community, we are hesitant to implement it, as\line   there is no sense of whether or how it might change in the future.  It is\line   our belief that SmartScale has not demonstrated sufficient usefulness as a\line   lossless format nor as a means of quality enhancement, and thus our primary\line   interest in providing this feature would be as a means of supporting\line   additional DCT scaling factors.\line\line - **libjpeg API: Fancy downsampling in compressor**<br>\line   `cinfo.do_fancy_downsampling` is silently ignored.\line   This requires the DCT scaling feature, which is not supported.\line\line - **jpegtran: Scaling**<br>\line   This requires both the DCT scaling and SmartScale features, which are not\line   supported.\line\line - **Lossless RGB JPEG files**<br>\line   This requires the SmartScale feature, which is not supported.\line\line ### What About libjpeg v9?\line\line libjpeg v9 introduced yet another field to the JPEG compression structure\line (`color_transform`), thus making the ABI backward incompatible with that of\line libjpeg v8.  This new field was introduced solely for the purpose of supporting\line lossless SmartScale encoding.  Furthermore, there was actually no reason to\line extend the API in this manner, as the color transform could have just as easily\line been activated by way of a new JPEG colorspace constant, thus preserving\line backward ABI compatibility.\line\line Our research (see link above) has shown that lossless SmartScale does not\line generally accomplish anything that can't already be accomplished better with\line existing, standard lossless formats.  Therefore, at this time it is our belief\line that there is not sufficient technical justification for software projects to\line upgrade from libjpeg v8 to libjpeg v9, and thus there is not sufficient\line technical justification for us to emulate the libjpeg v9 ABI.\line\line In-Memory Source/Destination Managers\line -------------------------------------\line\line By default, libjpeg-turbo 1.3 and later includes the `jpeg_mem_src()` and\line `jpeg_mem_dest()` functions, even when not emulating the libjpeg v8 API/ABI.\line Previously, it was necessary to build libjpeg-turbo from source with libjpeg v8\line API/ABI emulation in order to use the in-memory source/destination managers,\line but several projects requested that those functions be included when emulating\line the libjpeg v6b API/ABI as well.  This allows the use of those functions by\line programs that need them, without breaking ABI compatibility for programs that\line don't, and it allows those functions to be provided in the "official"\line libjpeg-turbo binaries.\line\line Those who are concerned about maintaining strict conformance with the libjpeg\line v6b or v7 API can pass an argument of `-DWITH_MEM_SRCDST=0` to `cmake` prior to\line building libjpeg-turbo.  This will restore the pre-1.3 behavior, in which\line `jpeg_mem_src()` and `jpeg_mem_dest()` are only included when emulating the\line libjpeg v8 API/ABI.\line\line On Un*x systems, including the in-memory source/destination managers changes\line the dynamic library version from 62.2.0 to 62.3.0 if using libjpeg v6b API/ABI\line emulation and from 7.2.0 to 7.3.0 if using libjpeg v7 API/ABI emulation.\line\line Note that, on most Un*x systems, the dynamic linker will not look for a\line function in a library until that function is actually used.  Thus, if a program\line is built against libjpeg-turbo 1.3+ and uses `jpeg_mem_src()` or\line `jpeg_mem_dest()`, that program will not fail if run against an older version\line of libjpeg-turbo or against libjpeg v7- until the program actually tries to\line call `jpeg_mem_src()` or `jpeg_mem_dest()`.  Such is not the case on Windows.\line If a program is built against the libjpeg-turbo 1.3+ DLL and uses\line `jpeg_mem_src()` or `jpeg_mem_dest()`, then it must use the libjpeg-turbo 1.3+\line DLL at run time.\line\line Both cjpeg and djpeg have been extended to allow testing the in-memory\line source/destination manager functions.  See their respective man pages for more\line details.\line\line\line Mathematical Compatibility\line ==========================\line\line For the most part, libjpeg-turbo should produce identical output to libjpeg\line v6b.  The one exception to this is when using the floating point DCT/IDCT, in\line which case the outputs of libjpeg v6b and libjpeg-turbo can differ for the\line following reasons:\line\line - The SSE/SSE2 floating point DCT implementation in libjpeg-turbo is ever so\line   slightly more accurate than the implementation in libjpeg v6b, but not by\line   any amount perceptible to human vision (generally in the range of 0.01 to\line   0.08 dB gain in PNSR.)\line\line - When not using the SIMD extensions, libjpeg-turbo uses the more accurate\line   (and slightly faster) floating point IDCT algorithm introduced in libjpeg\line   v8a as opposed to the algorithm used in libjpeg v6b.  It should be noted,\line   however, that this algorithm basically brings the accuracy of the floating\line   point IDCT in line with the accuracy of the accurate integer IDCT.  The\line   floating point DCT/IDCT algorithms are mainly a legacy feature, and they do\line   not produce significantly more accuracy than the accurate integer algorithms\line   (to put numbers on this, the typical difference in PNSR between the two\line   algorithms is less than 0.10 dB, whereas changing the quality level by 1 in\line   the upper range of the quality scale is typically more like a 1.0 dB\line   difference.)\line\line - If the floating point algorithms in libjpeg-turbo are not implemented using\line   SIMD instructions on a particular platform, then the accuracy of the\line   floating point DCT/IDCT can depend on the compiler settings.\line\line While libjpeg-turbo\f1\par
\f0  does emulate the libjpeg v8 API/ABI, under the hood it is\line still using the same algorithms as libjpeg v6b, so there are several specific\line cases in which libjpeg-turbo cannot be expected to produce the same output as\line libjpeg v8:\line\line - When decompressing using scaling factors of 1/2 and 1/4, because libjpeg v8\line   implements those scaling algorithms differently than libjpeg v6b does, and\line   libjpeg-turbo's SIMD extensions are based on the libjpeg v6b behavior.\line\line - When using chrominance subsampling, because libjpeg v8 implements this\line   with its DCT/IDCT scaling algorithms rather than with a separate\line   downsampling/upsampling algorithm.  In our testing, the subsampled/upsampled\line   output of libjpeg v8 is less accurate than that of libjpeg v6b for this\line   reason.\line\line - When decompressing using a scaling factor > 1 and merged (AKA "non-fancy" or\line   "non-smooth") chrominance upsampling, because libjpeg v8 does not support\line   merged upsampling with scaling factors > 1.\line\line\line Performance Pitfalls\line ====================\line\line Restart Markers\line ---------------\line\line The optimized Huffman decoder in libjpeg-turbo does not handle restart markers\line in a way that makes the rest of the libjpeg infrastructure happy, so it is\line necessary to use the slow Huffman decoder when decompressing a JPEG image that\line has restart markers.  This can cause the decompression performance to drop by\line as much as 20%, but the performance will still be much greater than that of\line libjpeg.  Many consumer packages, such as Photoshop, use restart markers when\line generating JPEG images, so images generated by those programs will experience\line this issue.\line\line Fast Integer Forward DCT at High Quality Levels\line -----------------------------------------------\line\line The algorithm used by the SIMD-accelerated quantization function cannot produce\line correct results whenever the fast integer forward DCT is used along with a JPEG\line quality of 98-100.  Thus, libjpeg-turbo must use the non-SIMD quantization\line function in those cases.  This causes performance to drop by as much as 40%.\line It is therefore strongly advised that you use the accurate integer forward DCT\line whenever encoding images with a JPEG quality of 98 or higher.\line\line\line Memory Debugger Pitfalls\line ========================\line\line Valgrind and Memory Sanitizer (MSan) can generate false positives\line (specifically, incorrect reports of uninitialized memory accesses) when used\line with libjpeg-turbo's SIMD extensions.  It is generally recommended that the\line SIMD extensions be disabled, either by passing an argument of `-DWITH_SIMD=0`\line to `cmake` when configuring the build or by setting the environment variable\line `JSIMD_FORCENONE` to `1` at run time, when testing libjpeg-turbo with Valgrind,\line MSan, or other memory debuggers.\line ;\line ; jsimdext.inc - common declarations\line ;\line ; Copyright 2009 Pierre Ossman <ossman@cendio.se> for Cendio AB\line ; Copyright (C) 2010, 2016, 2019, D.

It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy,\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line ^L\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line ^L\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line ^L\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it\line does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must\line be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least\line     three years, to give the same user the materials specified in\line     Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of\line     performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\line countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\line of the ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\line It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\line effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\line have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full\line notice is found.\line\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Additional Definitions. \line\line   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU\line General Public License.\line\line   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\line other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\line\line   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\line by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\line Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\line of using an interface provided by the Library.\line\line   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an\line Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\line with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked\line Version".\line\line   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the\line Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\line for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\line based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\line\line   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the\line object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\line and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\line Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\line\line   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line\line   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\line without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\line\line   2. Conveying Modified Versions.\line\line   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\line facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\line that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\line facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\line version:\line\line    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\line    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\line    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\line    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\line\line    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\line    this License applicable to that copy.\line\line   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\line\line   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\line a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\line code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\line material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\line layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\line (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\line\line    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\line    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line    covered by this License.\line\line    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line    document.\line\line   4. Combined Works.\line\line   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\line taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\line portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\line the following:\line\line    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\line    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\line    covered by this License.\line\line    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\line    document.\line\line    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\line    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\line    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\line    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\line\line    d) Do one of the following:\line\line        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\line        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\line        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\line        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\line        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\line        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\line        Corresponding Source.\line\line        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\line        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\line        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\line        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\line        Version. \line\line    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\line    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\line    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  is\line    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\line    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\line    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\line    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\line    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\line    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\line    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\line    for conveying Corresponding Source.)\line\line   5. Combined Libraries.\line\line   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side by side in a single library together with other library\line facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\line License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\line choice, if you do both of the following:\line\line    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\line    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\line    conveyed under the terms of this License.\line\line    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\line    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\line    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\line\line   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\line versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\line differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\line Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\line of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"\line applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that published version or of any later version\line published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\line received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\line General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\line\line   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\line whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\line apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\line permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\line Library.\line libuv is licensed for use as follows:\line\line ====\line Copyright (c) 2015-present libuv project contributors.\line\line Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\line of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to\line deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the\line rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or\line sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\line furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\line\line The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\line all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\line\line THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\line IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\line FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It is\line  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\line\line\tab\tab\tab     Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\line other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\line your libraries, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\line you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\line with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\line the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\line version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\line the original authors' reputations.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\line software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\line transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\line we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\line free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\line GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\line license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\line designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\line one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\line the same as in the ordinary license.\line\line   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\line they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\line program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\line changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\line analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\line a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\line derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\line treats it as such.\line\line   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\line Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\line sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\line concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\line\line   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\line users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\line libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\line permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\line preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\line libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\line this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\line changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\line will lead to faster development of free libraries.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\line works together with the library.\line\line   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\line General Public License rather than by this special one.\line\f1\par
\f0\line\tab\tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\line contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\line party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\line General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is\line addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line   \line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\line distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line\tab\tab\tab     NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line\tab\tab      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Library General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the \line     Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, \line     Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line\line   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\line   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\line\line   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\line   Ty Coon, President of Vice\line\line That's all there is to it!\line\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                        Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations\line below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line ^L\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\line becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line ^L\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\line compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line ^L\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line ^L\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line ^L\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy,\f1\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0  modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9.

Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line ^L\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\line License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\line software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\line General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\line Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\line using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\line the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\line your programs, too.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\line price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\line have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\line this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\line if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\line in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\line These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\line distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\line gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\line you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\line source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\line rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\line (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\line distribute and/or modify the software.\line\line   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\line that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\line software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\line want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\line that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\line authors' reputations.\line\line   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\line patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\line program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\line program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\line patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.\line\line                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\line a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\line under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\line refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\line means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\line that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\line either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\line language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\line the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\line is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\line Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\line Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\line source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\line conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\line copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\line notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\line and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\line along with the Program.\line\line You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\line you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\line\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\line     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\line     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\line     parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\line     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\line     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\line     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\line     notice\f1\par
\f0  that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\line     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\line     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\line     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\line     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\line     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Program.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\line with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\line under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\line Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\line\line     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\line     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\line     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\line\line     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\line     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\line     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\line     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\line     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\line     customarily used for software interchange; or,\line\line     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\line     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\line     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\line     received the program in object code or executable form with such\line     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\line\line The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\line code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\line associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\line control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\line special exception, the source code distributed need not include\line anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\line form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\line operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\line itself accompanies the executable.\line\line If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\line access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\line access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\line distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\line except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\line otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\line void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\line However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\line this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\line parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Program or works based on it.\line\line   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\line Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\line these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\line this License.\line\line   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\line any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\line apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\line circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\line may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\line those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\line countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\line the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\line\line   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\line of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\line be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\line address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any\line later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\line either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\line Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\line this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\line Foundation.\line\line   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\line to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\line Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\line make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\line of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\line of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\line FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\line OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\line PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\line OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\line MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\line TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\line PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\line REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\line WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\line REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\line INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\line OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\line TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\line YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\line PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\line POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\line             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\line\line   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make\f1\par
\f0  it\line free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\line\line   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\line to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\line the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\line     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\line     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\line     (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\line     GNU General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\line     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\line     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\line when it starts in an interactive mode:\line\line     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\line     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\line     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\line     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\line\line The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\line parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\line be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\line mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\line necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\line\line   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\line   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\line\line   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\line   Ty Coon, President of Vice\line\line This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\line proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\line consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\line library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\line Public License instead of this License.\line All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public\line domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies\line they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the\line public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe\line at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,\line compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code\line form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,\line and by any means.\line\line The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in\line SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship\line with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for\line example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other\line open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final\line deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those\line scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the\line SQLite library.\line\line All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch.

Here\line     is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this\line     package (but check the individual files to be sure!):\line\line       - liblzma is in the public domain.\line\line       - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public\line         domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked\line         in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under\line         GNU LGPLv2.1+.\line\line       - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been\line         adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are\line         under GNU GPLv2+.\line\line       - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the\line         XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories\line         are in the public domain.\line\line       - Translated messages are in the public domain.\line\line       - The build system contains public domain files, and files that\line         are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up\line         in the binaries being built.\line\line       - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging\line         utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.\line\line       - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files\line         that are under various free software licenses.\line\line     You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into\line     the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,\line     take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find\line     the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many\line     lawyers.\line\line     As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.\line\line     If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils\line     into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is\line     polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but\line     naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good\line     notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:\line\line         This software includes code from XZ Utils <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tukaani.org/xz/"}}{\fldrslt{https://tukaani.org/xz/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >.\line\line     The following license texts are included in the following files:\line       - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1\line       - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2\line       - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3\line\line     Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code\line     pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma\line     binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety\line     even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source\line     package.\line\line     If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more\line     information.\line\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line                        Version 2.1, February 1999\line\line  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\line  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\line  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\line\line [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\line  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\line  the version number 2.1.]\line\line                             Preamble\line\line   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\line freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\line Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\line free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\line\line   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\line specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\line Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\line can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\line this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\line strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\line\line   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\line not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\line you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\line for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\line it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\line it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\line these things.\line\line   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\line distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\line rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\line you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\line\line   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\line or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\line you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\line code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\line complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\line with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\line it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\line\line   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\line library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\line permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\line\line   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\line there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\line modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\line that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\line author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\line introduced by others.\line\f1\par

\pard\pagebb\nowidctlpar\hyphpar0\f0\line   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\line any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\line effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\line restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\line any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\line consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\line\line   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\line ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\line General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\line is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\line this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\line libraries into non-free programs.\line\line   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\line a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\line combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\line General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\line entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\line Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\line the library.\line\line   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\line does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\line Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\line of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\line are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\line libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\line special circumstances.\line\line   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\line encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\line a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\line allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\line library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\line case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\line software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\line\line   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\line programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\line free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\line non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\line operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\line system.\line\line   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\line users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\line linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\line that program using a modified version of the Library.\line\line   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\line modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\line "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\line former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\line be combined with the library in order to run.\line\f1\par
\f0\line                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\line    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\line\line   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\line program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\line other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\line this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").\line Each licensee is addressed as "you".\line\line   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data\line prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\line (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\line\line   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work\line which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the\line Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under\line copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\line portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\line straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\line included without limitation in the term "modification".)\line\line   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\line making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\line all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\line interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\line and installation of the library.\line\line   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\line covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\line running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\line such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\line on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\line writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\line and what the program that uses the Library does.\line\line   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\line complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\line you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\line appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\line all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\line warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\line Library.\line\line   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\line and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\line fee.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\line of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\line distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\line above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\line\line     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\line\line     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\line     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\line\line     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\line     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\line\line     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\line     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\line     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\line     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\line     in the event an application does not supply such function or\line     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\line     its purpose remains meaningful.\line\line     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\line     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\line     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\line     application-supplied function or table used by this function must\line     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\line     root function must still compute square roots.)\line\line These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\line identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\line and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\line themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\line sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\line distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\line on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\line this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\line entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\line it.\line\line Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\line your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\line exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\line collective works based on the Library.\line\line In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\line with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\line a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\line the scope of this License.\line\line   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\line License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\line this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\line that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\line instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\line ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\line that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\line these notices.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\line that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\line subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\line\line   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\line the Library into a program that is not a library.\line\line   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\line derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\line under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\line it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\line must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\line medium customarily used for software interchange.\line\line   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\line from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\line source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\line distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\line compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\line\line   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\line Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\line linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a\line work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\line therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\line\line   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library\line creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\line contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the\line library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\line Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\line\line   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file\line that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\line derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\line Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\line linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\line threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\line\line   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\line structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\line functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\line file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\line work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\line Library will still fall under Section 6.)\line\line   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\line distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\line Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\line whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\line link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a\line work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\line under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\line modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\line engineering for debugging such modifications.\line\line   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\line Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\line this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\line during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\line copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\line directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\line of these things:\line\line     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\line     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\line     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\line     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\line     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that\line     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the\line     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\line     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\line     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\line     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\line     to use the modified definitions.)\line\line     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\line     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\line     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\line     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\line     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\line     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\line     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\line\line     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\line     least three years, to give the same user the materials\line     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\line     than the cost of performing this distribution.\line\line     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\line     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\line     specified materials from the same place.\line\line     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\line     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\line\line   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the\line Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for\line reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\line the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\line normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\line components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\line which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\line the executable.\line\line   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\line restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\line accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\line use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\line distribute.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\line Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\line facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\line library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\line the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\line permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\line\line     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\line     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\line     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\line     Sections above.\line\line     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\line     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\line     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\line\line   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\line the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\line attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\line distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\line rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\line or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\line terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\line\line   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\line signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\line distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\line prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\line modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\line all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\line the Library or works based on it.\line\line   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\line Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\line original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\line subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\line restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\line You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\line this License.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\line infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\line conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\line excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\line distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\line License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\line may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\line license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\line all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\line the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\line refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\line\line If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\line particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\line and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\line\line It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\line patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\line such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\line integrity of the free software distribution system which is\line implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\line generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\line through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\line system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\line to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\line impose that choice.\line\line This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\line be a consequence of the rest of this License.\line\line   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\line certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\line original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\line an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\line so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\line excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\line written in the body of this License.\line\line   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\line versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\line Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\line but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\line\line Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\line specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\line "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\line license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\line\f1\par
\f0\line   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\line programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\line write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\line copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\line Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\line decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\line of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\line and reuse of software generally.\line\line                             NO WARRANTY\line\line   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\line WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\line EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\line OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\line KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\line IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\line PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\line LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\line THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\line\line   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\line WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\line AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\line FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\line CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\line LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\line RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\line FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\line SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\line DAMAGES.\line\line                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line\f1\par
\f0\line            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\line\line   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\line possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\line everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\line redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\line ordinary General Public License).\line\line   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\line safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\line convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\line "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\line\line     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\line     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\line     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\line\line     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\line     Lesser General Public License for more details.\line\line     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\line     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\line     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\line\line Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\line\line You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\line school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if\line necessary.
